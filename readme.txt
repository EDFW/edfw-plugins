EDFW WEBSITE PLUGINS REPO

Most of the plugins on the EDFW site are used strictly as-is from the WP plugin depository, and are updated directly as needed.
This repo is specifically for:
1. Any ad-hoc plugins created specifically for the EDFW site.
2. Plugins altered for any reason.

Note that in the case of #2, the ORIGINAL SOURCE for the plugin should be the first commit.
